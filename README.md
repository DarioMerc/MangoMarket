# Mango Market

### ***\*\*\*STILL IN DEVELOPMENT\*\*\****
### Fake E-Commerce site selling imported mango varieties from around the world.
Made using React, Redux, NodeJs, Express, MongoDB and React Bootstrap (eventually id like to switch to tailwind)
Deployed here: https://themangomarket.herokuapp.com/  
Please note that currently the paypal implementation is not working due to a dependecy issue (react-paypal-button-v2[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paypal-button-v2] does not work with react version 18 yet)
## TODO
- finish order and checkout process
- pagination and filters
- re-style (lots of padding and margin issues)
- re-style entire site with tailwind (?)
- add banner in homepage explaining site
- contact us (?)
- fake FAQ (?)
